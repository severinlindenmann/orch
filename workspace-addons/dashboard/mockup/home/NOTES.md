Round 2 — working shared components.

### home.html
- Connected this page to the shared dialog, menu, dropdown, switch, toast, keyboard and motion behaviour.
- Kept the shared shell, real demo content and Preview states; dialogs now close with a visible button, Escape or a backdrop click and return focus.
- Questions now share recommended choices, a checked written answer, an answered state and Undo; phone and desktop show the same reply.

Round 2 validation: the shared browser sweep passed all 171 loaded/loading/empty page checks and 144 dialog/viewer checks. Targeted phone, question, keyboard, calendar, full-screen and toolbar checks also passed. See `../system/COMPONENT-QA.md` for the complete inventory and results.
